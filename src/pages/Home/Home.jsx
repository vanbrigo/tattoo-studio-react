                We are also one of only few studios in London to have been awarded 4/4 <br />star rating by the Tattoo Hygiene Rating Scheme.<br />
                Our studio is designed and created by female tattoo artists. <br />Tattoo stations are fitted with hygienic, purpose-built equipment. <br />
                We operate a completely disposable system <br />so that we have no need for scrub rooms or re-sterilised tools. <br />
                All of this makes Velvet Underground Tattoo<br /> a reassuringly clean and comfortable environment to be inked.
